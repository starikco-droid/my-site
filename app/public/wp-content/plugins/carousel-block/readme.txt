You can reorder the slides by using the left and right arrow buttons in the toolbar.

= Upgrading from Legacy Carousel =

- Existing legacy (v1) Carousel Slider blocks will still work. You can re-enable them in the admin settings under **Settings â†’ Carousel Slider**.
- To upgrade, click on a legacy Carousel Slider block in the editor. In the block's toolbar (the floating bar that appears above the block), click the **block icon (first button on the left)**. From the dropdown, choose **"Transform to Carousel Slider v2"**. Your existing carousel settings will be preserved, but note that the design and HTML markup will change.
- Legacy styles will not apply to v2. You may need to adjust custom CSS. 

**Optional: Re-enable Legacy Blocks**

You can show/hide legacy blocks from the block inserter and disable v2 upgrade notices via **Settings â†’ Carousel Slider** in the admin menu.

**Note**: Legacy blocks will continue to function, but are no longer supported. It is highly recommended to upgrade to v2 for continued improvements and compatibility.

= Customizing v2 Styles =

Carousel Slider v2 supports custom styling via CSS variables:

### Navigation  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--navigation-size`: Arrow size  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--navigation-sides-offset`: Distance from edge  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--navigation-color`: Arrow color  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--navigation-alignfull-color`: Arrow color when the carousel is full width

### Pagination (dots)  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--pagination-top`: Top offset for pagination  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--pagination-bullet-size`: Dot size  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--pagination-bullet-color`: Dot color (inactive)  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--pagination-bullet-active-color`: Dot color (active)  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--pagination-bullet-opacity`: Dot opacity (inactive)  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--pagination-bullet-active-opacity`: Dot opacity (active)  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--pagination-bullet-horizontal-gap`: Horizontal spacing between dots  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--pagination-bullet-vertical-gap`: Vertical spacing between dots  

### Block spacing  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--image-margin-top`: Top spacing for image blocks 
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--image-margin-bottom`: Bottom spacing for image blocks
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--cover-margin-top`: Top spacing for cover blocks  
- `--wp--custom--carousel-block--cover-margin-bottom`: Bottom spacing for cover blocks

Note: The CSS variables use the WordPress `--wp--custom--` prefix, allowing you to override them in your theme's theme.json for site-wide styling.
